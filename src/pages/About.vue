        <h1>Stephen Palmer</h1>
        <h4><span>Variety Oil Painter</span></h4>
        <p>Creator of Burt the Worm™, JungleVille™, The Escape from Swiss Cheese Island™, Infinite Travels™ as well as
          The Carrot Patch™, Stephen Palmer is known as one of the most prolific creatives in the industry. With
          Stephen's work, you can expect to see a majority of landscapes; especially ones with old weathered wood,
          followed by still life's and portraits with a touch of illustration and figure study.</p>
        <p>Stephen began creating art at a young age by copying doodles of Calvin from <i>Bill Watterson's Calvin and
            Hobbes</i>, and tracing illustrations out of Shel Silverstein's poem books <i>Light in the Attic</i> and
          <i>The Giving Tree</i>, after being inspired by a drawing of himself given to him by his father. In his spare
          time, he enjoys watching cartoons and movies, playing lacrosse, gold panning and walking his dog, Tiki.
          Stephen aims to capture beauty on a canvas in hopes to bring a memorable emotion to his viewers, young and
          old.
        </p>
